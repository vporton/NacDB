- RBT does not free memory when an item is deleted! Especially note `Inserting`/`Creating`.

- It can be abused by calling with the same GUID after complete accomplishing
  of an operation.

- Documentation `mo-doc` and `typedoc`.

- Maybe, `Text` keys instead of `Nat` for `SubDBKey` (and pass this key when creating sub-DB)?
